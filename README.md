### Map of UFO Sightings and Drug Deaths

It was hypothesized that areas with heavier drug users would have more sightings. A map illustrates the relationship between the number of deaths from illicit substances reported for each state in 2018 and the number of reported sightings in January and February of 2014.

### Visualization of Word Assocations and UFO Shape

Analysis was done on comments from individuals reporting sightings. An interactive circle-packing map shows the associations between particular phrases and types of shapes reported. For example, individuals who reported seeing UFO shapes that resembled fireballs were more likely to use descriptive words associated with light and heat such as *glowing*, *pulsating*, *orange*, etc.
