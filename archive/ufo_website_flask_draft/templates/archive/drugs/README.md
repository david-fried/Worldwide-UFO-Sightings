## Purpose: 

This map shows the extent of drug deaths between states as indicated by different colors, and it overlays markers representing 1,000 UFO sightings. (The original data file had over 80,000 sightings.) The markers show information about sightings.


## Important: 

1. To get the map to work you need to first update the config.js file located at static/js/config.js with your API Key. This is the same key you used for all of the class leaflet exercises.

2. You then need to run python -m http.server in this directory and vist you localhost:800 in your webbrowser.


## Note: 

I used json data containing states coordinates at https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/us-states.js.

I found this leaflet documentation helpful for creating the map (https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/).

Also, Day 1, Activity 10 was helpful.
